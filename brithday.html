	<p>HAPPPIEST BIRTHDAY TO THE MOST IMPORTANT
PERSON OF OUR LIFE♡
You are elder than us in age but We’ve always felt
like you were more of our younger sister! It’s always been a
good time with you. We don’t wanna say nice things about you
but we are using it as a chance because it’s your birthday.
When people split due to misunderstandings, we three became
friends instead still remember the day where we started
our journey!!!The time spent with you are one of the most
beautiful memories of our life. When people attend classes in
google meet, we made memories instead.(◜‿◝) ♡ HAPPY
TWENTY SWETHA!!!Never believed in forever but would love
to continue this journey as long as we can we will wish you
for your 100th birthday as. We won’t let you down.We always
got your back. LOVE YOU SO MUCH!! ʘ‿ʘ and these words
wouldn’t really summarize anything We’ve for you but wait for
		all the upcoming years to know the rest. ♡♡</p>
		<p>With lots of love,
			Dharun and Losh</p>
